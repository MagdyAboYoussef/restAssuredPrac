# restAssuredPractice project

This project is written in restAssured non-bdd style by using bdd in cucumber using restful-booker api, we send requsts and assert on responses. 
The test cases are written in cucumber in main/resouces/features.
To run the testcases we run them through testrunners to see the logs.
